Quick design session

When a team favors ["simple design"](yagni.html), developers usually handle local design decisions moment-to-moment, but are on the alert for design choices that may have far-reaching consequences.
When such a choice arises, two or more developers meet for a quick design session at the whiteboard, possibly using design aids such as [CRC cards](crc.html).
Some important guidelines for an effective design session are:

* considering several credible alternatives ("straw man" proposals don't count), ideally three or more, so that the final choice is based on considerations such as simplicity or conceptual integrity;
* assessing each alternative on the basis of a concrete, specific scenario; for instance envisioning how the [acceptance test](acceptance.html) associated with a given [user story](stories.html) would unfold under each possible design.
