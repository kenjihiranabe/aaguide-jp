Niko-niko calendar

The team installs a [calendar](http://www.geocities.jp/nikonikocalendar/pics_en/jirei.JPG) one one of the room's walls. The format of the calendar allows each team member to record, at the end of every workday, a graphic evaluation of their mood during that day. This can be either a hand-drawn "emoticon", or a colored sticker, following a simple color code, for instance: blue for a bad day, red for neutral, yellow for a good day.
Over time, the niko-niko calendar reveals patterns of change in the moods of the team, or of individual members.
