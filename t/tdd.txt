TDD

"Test-driven development" refers to a style of programming in which three activities are tightly interwoven: coding, testing (in the form of writing [unit tests](unittest.html)) and design (in the form of [refactoring](refactoring.html)).
It can be succinctly described by the following set of rules:

* write a **single** unit test describing an aspect of the program
* run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature
* write **just enough** code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass
* **refactor** the code until it conforms to the [simplicity criteria](simplicity.html)
* repeat, **accumulating** unit tests over time
