Lead time

"Lead time" is a term borrowed from the manufacturing method known as Lean or Toyota Production System, where it is defined as the time elapsed between a customer placing an order and receiving the product ordered.
Translated to the software domain, lead time can be described more abstractly as the time elapsed between the identification of a requirement and its fulfillment. Defining a more concrete measurement depends on the situation being examined: for instance, when focusing on the software development process, the "lead time" elapsed between the formulation of a [user story](stories.html) and that story being used "in production", that is, by actual users under normal conditions.
Teams opting for the [kanban](kanban.html) approach favor this measure, over the better known [velocity](velocity.html). Instead of aiming at increasing velocity, improvement initiatives intend to reduce lead time.
