Backlog

A backlog is a list of features or technical tasks which the team maintains and which, at a given moment, are known to be necessary and sufficient to complete a project or a release:

  * if an item on the backlog does not contribute to the project's goal, it should be removed;
  * on the other hand, if at any time a task or feature becomes known that is considered necessary to the project, it should be added to the backlog.

These "necessary and sufficient" properties are assessed relative to the team's state of knowledge at a particular moment; the backlog is expected to change throughout the project's duration as the team gains knowledge.
The backlog is the primary point of entry for knowledge about requirements, and the single authoritative source defining the work to be done.
