Burndown chart

The team displays, somewhere on a wall of the project room, a large graph relating the quantity of work remaining (on the vertical axis) and the time elapsed since the start of the project (on the horizontal, showing future as well as past). This constitutes an "[information radiator](radiator.html)", provided it is updated regularly.
Two variants exist, depending on whether the amount graphed is for the work remaining in the iteration ("sprint burndown") or more commonly the entire project ("product burndown").
