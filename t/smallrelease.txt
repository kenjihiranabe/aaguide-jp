Frequent releases

An Agile team frequently releases its product into the hands of end users, listening to feedback, whether critical or appreciative.
Precisely how frequent is desirable varies according to the technical and business aspects of the context, but in general one release every four to six iterations would be considered a maximum.
In favorable technical contexts, such as Web development, a more frequent rhythm of release can be achieved, such as every iteration. Some teams push this practice to its limit of [continuous deployment](cd.html).
