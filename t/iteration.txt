Iteration

An iteration, in the context of an Agile project, is a [timebox](timebox.html) during which development takes place, the duration of which:

* may vary from project to project, usually between 1 and 4 weeks
* is in most cases fixed for the duration of a given project

A key feature of Agile approaches is the underlying assumption that a project consists excusively of a sequence of iterations, possibly with the exception of a very brief "vision and planning" phase prior to development, and a similarly brief "closure" phase after it.
In general iterations are aligned with calendar weeks, often starting on mondays and ending on fridays; this is more a matter of convenience than an explicit recommendation and many teams adopt different conventions.
The fixed length of iterations gives teams a simple way to obtain, based on [velocity](velocity.html) and the amount of work remaining, a usually accurate (though not very precise) estimation of the project's remaining duration.
