      The Given-When-Then formula is a template intended to guide the writing of [acceptance tests](acceptance.html) for a [User Story](story.html):

      *  (Given) some context
      *  (When) some action is carried out
      *  (Then) a particular set of observable consequences should obtain

      An exemple:

      *  Given my bank account is in credit, and I made no withdrawals recently,
      *  When I attempt to withdraw an amount less than my card's limit,
      *  Then the withdrawal should complete without errors or warnings

      Tools such as JBehave, RSpec or Cucumber encourage use of this template, though it can also be used purely as a heuristic irrespective of any tool.
