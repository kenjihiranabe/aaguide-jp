      Version control is not strictly speaking an Agile "practice", insofar as it is now (fortunately) widespread in the industry as a whole.
      It must however be mentioned here for several reasons:

      * though they are rare, one still occasionally stumbles across teams with outdated version control tools or practices, and even teams who haven't adopted version control tools at all
      * version control is not merely "good practice" but an enabler of a number of Agile practices, such as [continuous integration](ci.html)
      * the Agile community leans toward particular types of tools and practices, namely the same as the Open Source community: systems that afford concurrent work ("merge" model rather than "lock"), and more recently favoring distributed over centralized models
      * it is therefore beneficial for an Agile team to explicitly reflect on its version control policies and infrastructure, and ensure that they and its engineering practices work harmoniously together.
